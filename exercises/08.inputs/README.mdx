# Inputs

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-fundamentals/intro-to-inputs" />

There are lots of different types of form elements built-into the browser you
can use (of varying degrees of usefulness because of the way they are designed).
[Find a list of standard input types here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input).

In general, you use these form elements in React the same way you use them in
regular HTML, but there are a few exceptions (especially regarding default
values). So we're going to explore all the types of form elements in this
exercise.

There are a number of ways you can be notified of changes to form elements.
We'll not be covering them in this workshop (we'll get into it more in a future
workshop when we talk about managing state), but if you just can't wait, play
around with `onChange` (which behaves like
[the browser's `input` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/input_event)).
